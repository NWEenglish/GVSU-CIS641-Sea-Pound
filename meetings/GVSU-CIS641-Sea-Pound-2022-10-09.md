Discussion points: 

* What went well last week?
	* Map was created and we have invisible walls in place.
	* Main menu was created and can open the sandbox level.
* How is the project looking?
	* Looks mostly good. 
	* "View Controls" was not spec'd out and will need to be added. A
	* We need a message for the player to know that they need to click to leave those main menu screens.
* Are we on track?
	* Yes! Sprint was completed and, technically, nothing had to be rolled over to next sprint.
	* Will need to complete items listed above as tech debt.

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Nicholas English:
	* Update main menu:
		* Add "View Controls"
		* Add note in "View Controls" and "View Credits" that those screens can be closed by clicking anywhere.
	* Create the two new enemies:
		* Need a guard unit that can chase after the player.
		* Need a stationary unit that cannot chase after the player.
		* Both of these will need sprites sourced and potentially different audio.
