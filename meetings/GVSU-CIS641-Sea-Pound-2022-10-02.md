Team name: Sea Pound (C#)

Members present: Nicholas English

Date: 10/2/2022

Time: 11:00 PM

Discussion points: 

* What went well last week?
	* Project setup went smoothly.
	* Completed all tasks related to the player moving their tank and shooting from it.
* How is the project looking?
	* Looks great! The player object is mostly done and additional features related to the player object will come later.
* Are we on track?
	* Yes! Sprint was completed and nothing had to be rolled over to next sprint.
	* Similar to last sprint, this sprint was completed early. Again, no additional sprint work was added on to this sprint though. This is something important we need to consider doing as it will help ensure future sprints won't be incomplete.

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Nicholas English:
	* Create the main menu:
		* Should be first thing the player sees.
		* Player should be able to quit to this screen.
	* Create the first map:
		* Should have physical walls that prevent objects from passing through.
			* Current objects: player tank body, player tank barrel, and missiles.
		* Add interactable objects on map.
		* Will need textures, sprites, and ambiance sound sourced.
