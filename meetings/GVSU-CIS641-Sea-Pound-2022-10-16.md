Time: 6:00 PM

Discussion points: 

* What went well last week?
	* Created the two enemies.
	* Created a spawner object that could spawn enemies onto the map.
	* Added physics for the projectiles being shot, which includes collision detection.
	* Enemies/Player will die if health reaches 0 hp.
* How is the project looking?
	* Looks great!
	* An unintended feature of Unity's collision detection is that it pushes the entitity back on collision. Originally, I wanted to remove this, but I think it actually is nice. 
	Real world example of a bug becoming a feature.
* Are we on track?
	* Yes! Sprint was completed and nothing had to be rolled over to next sprint.
	* Looking ahead, after this coming sprint is the two sprints that focus on the online DB. We may want to scrap that feature since this is an offline game, so why bother having an online feature?
