	* Migrated project from Microsoft Cloud to Github.
	* Completed tutorial and able to go above and beyond what was done in it.
* How is the project looking?
	* The project hasn't truly "started" yet since the tutorial was for setup and proof of concept.
* Are we on track?
	* Yes! Sprint was completed and nothing had to be rolled over to next sprint.
	* Could've pulled from next sprint, should consider doing this next time sprint is ahead of schedule.

Goals for next week (include responsibilities)

* Restart the game project and write the code without direct use of the tutorial.
* Create the player object with movement, sprites, and audio.
* Create the shooting mechanic with the barrel movement, sprites, and audio.
