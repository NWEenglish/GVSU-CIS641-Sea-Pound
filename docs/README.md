# Project Overview
Sea Pound (C#) will be creating a 2D, top down game. The game puts the player in control of a tank, which 
will be able to drive around a map and destroy A.I. enemies. Two types of enemies will exist: a stationary 
turret and a guard unit, which can chase the player if it becomes alerted to its presence. There are also 
two planned game modes: an offensive mode and a defensive mode. The offensive mode has the player attempting 
to destroy multiple objectives, while the defensive mode has the player attempt to survive waves of enemies. 
The game will also feature cloud storage, which will hold all players progress and will allow the player to 
see where they sit on the leaderboard.

The game is going to be built through Unity and C# code, which will be developed in the Visual Studio IDE. 
Cloud storage will be hosted in Firebase and accessed through a client API. Model and sound effect assets 
will be sourced from legal, free libraries that allow our usage of them in this game, and with credit given 
to the content creators.
