# Introduction
Sea Pound (C#) will be creating a 2D, top down game. The game puts the player in control of a tank, which will be able to drive around a map and destroy A.I. enemies. Two types of enemies will exist: a stationary turret and a guard unit, which can chase the player if it becomes alerted to its presence. There are also two planned game modes: an offensive mode and a defensive mode. The offensive mode has the player attempting to destroy multiple objectives, while the defensive mode has the player attempt to survive waves of enemies. The game will also feature cloud storage, which will hold all players progress and will allow the player to see where they sit on the leaderboard.

The game is going to be built through Unity and C# code, which will be developed in the Visual Studio IDE. Cloud storage will be hosted in Firebase and accessed through a client API. Model and sound effect assets will be sourced from legal, free libraries that allow our usage of them in this game, and with credit given to the content creators. 

# Anticipated Technologies
- Unity
- Visual Studio 2019
- GitKraken
- Firebase

# Method/Approach
Following a more Agile approach. Planning to work in weekly sprints, which will end Sunday nights. Each sprint will be to complete a small, but unique feature, which will work to slowly build up the game. Ideally, the project will be heavier at the start, so that around Thanksgiving, the team can pivot to easier features and can focus more on bug squashing as the project nears its due date.
